This is the repo for the final year project: Overkill Reloaded

things to add:

change cursors to be 32x32 instead of 50x50


make it so bullets are deleted if they collide with walls or after a 5 second delay 

make it so when you kill the boss the wave goes and change it so that all the increasing variables are done through adding (the increased number) * the wave number 
change it so that enemies stop spawning when the "enemies_spawned" equals to the "max_enemy_spawned" variable to stop overcrowding 
make it so when an enemy is spawned it increments enemies_spawned and when the boss is dead make the variable equal to zero
add wave counter 
gameover screen when the player hits below 100 health





ricochet for bullets
punch through for bullets
dodging 

shop (change it so that after you beat the boss instead of just increasing the current wave you go to the shop and when you exit it the current wave advances)
add power ups (inf ammo, nuke)
implement glass cannon mode and extreme mode
